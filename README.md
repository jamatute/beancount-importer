# Beancount-importers

Here are a pair of beancount importers:

* For the [F-droid Budget app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.notriddle.budget/)
* For a bank csv

Thank you to [mterwill](https://github.com/mterwill), I took his
[gist](https://gist.github.com/mterwill/7fdcc573dc1aa158648aacd4e33786e8) as
reference

## Features for the Budget importer

* If the Budget envelope starts with `Debt:` it will count as an Asset else it
  will be counted as an Expense
* It will assume `Assets:Cash` as the default second transaction posting

## Features for the bank importer

The CSV must have the following columns:

* empty column
* Execution date of the transfer
* Date of value
* Description
* Import
* Global account amount

The name of the file must be "Data-{{ asset_account_name }}.csv"

You can specify a yaml of rules to match by default in
`~/.config/beancount-importers/bank_alias_rules.yml`, for example:

```yaml
- regexp: '.*RISEUP.*'
  account: 'Expenses:Bills:Email'
  payee: 'Riseup'
  description: 'Donation to Riseup'
```

Right now you must fill all the keys for each dictionary, or it won't work.
